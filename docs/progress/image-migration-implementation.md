# Image Migration Implementation Roadmap

**Generated**: 2025-08-02T01:05:00Z  
**Status**: Ready for execution

## Objective
Migrate 2,692 product images from local storage to Shopify CDN using the staged upload process, with database updates to reflect new Shopify image URLs.

## Current State Analysis
- **Database**: All images still point to old `izerwaren.biz` URLs (production migration failed previously)
- **Local Files**: 2,692 images ready in `/apps/frontend/public/images_bak/products/`
- **Shopify Auth**: ✅ FIXED - Staged upload authentication working (test upload successful)
- **Upload Manifest**: ✅ Ready at `.taskmaster/reports/upload-manifest.json`

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Upload Success**: >95% of 2,692 images successfully uploaded to Shopify CDN
2. **Database Updates**: All successful uploads have database records updated with Shopify URLs
3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring with batch progress and ETA
4. **Error Handling**: Failed uploads logged with specific error messages for retry
5. **Validation**: Sample verification that uploaded images are accessible via Shopify URLs

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Validation (5 minutes)
- ✅ Verify staged upload authentication (test script passed)
- ✅ Confirm upload manifest exists and is current
- ✅ Validate database connection and state
- ✅ Check local image file accessibility

### Phase 2: Production Migration (45-60 minutes)
- **Batch Processing**: 5 images per batch with 1-second rate limiting
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time console output with ETA
- **Database Updates**: Atomic updates per successful upload
- **Error Recovery**: Continue on failure, log for retry
- **Intermediate Saves**: Progress reports every 10 batches

### Phase 3: Post-Migration Validation (10 minutes)
- Verify final upload statistics
- Sample-test Shopify URLs accessibility
- Generate comprehensive upload report
- Update project status documentation

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **API Rate Limiting**: 
   - *Risk*: Shopify throttles requests causing cascade failures
   - *Mitigation*: 1-second delays between uploads, exponential backoff on 429 errors

2. **Authentication Expiry**:
   - *Risk*: Shopify access token expires during long migration
   - *Mitigation*: Token refresh logic, session validation before batches

3. **Local File Corruption**:
   - *Risk*: Images fail validation during upload
   - *Mitigation*: Pre-validation phase, graceful skip with logging

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - *Risk*: Database updates fail causing URL sync issues
   - *Mitigation*: Database connection pooling, retry logic for updates

2. **Disk Space**:
   - *Risk*: Local storage full during process
   - *Mitigation*: Pre-check available space, monitor during upload

### Low Priority Risks
1. **Network Intermittency**:
   - *Risk*: Temporary network issues
   - *Mitigation*: Retry logic with exponential backoff

## Test Hooks & Validation Points

### Pre-Migration Tests
```bash
# 1. Authentication test
npx tsx scripts/test-staged-upload.ts

# 2. Database connectivity
npx tsx scripts/check-db-state.ts

# 3. File system validation
ls -la apps/frontend/public/images_bak/products/ | wc -l
```

### During Migration Monitoring
- Console progress output with success/failure counts
- Intermediate progress reports at `.taskmaster/reports/image-upload-progress.json`
- Database query to check real-time URL updates

### Post-Migration Validation
```bash
# 1. Final statistics
cat .taskmaster/reports/image-upload-final-report.json

# 2. Database verification
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT count(*) FROM product_images WHERE image_url LIKE 'https://cdn.shopify.com%'"

# 3. Sample URL testing
npx tsx scripts/verify-shopify-images.ts
```

## Execution Commands

### Start Production Migration
```bash
cd /Users/noelmcmichael/Workspace/izerwaren_revamp_2_0
npx tsx scripts/image-migration-production.ts
```

### Monitor Progress (separate terminal)
```bash
tail -f .taskmaster/reports/image-upload-progress.json
```

### Emergency Stop (if needed)
```bash
# Ctrl+C to stop gracefully
# Progress will be saved automatically
```

## Success Metrics
- **Upload Rate**: Target >95% success rate
- **Performance**: <1.5 seconds average upload time
- **Database Integrity**: 100% of successful uploads have updated URLs
- **Error Rate**: <5% total failures (acceptable for retry)

## Next Steps After Completion
1. **Retry Failed Uploads**: Address any failed images individually
2. **Frontend Integration**: Update image display components to use Shopify URLs
3. **Legacy Cleanup**: Archive local image files after verification
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate image loading speeds from Shopify CDN

**Ready for Execution**: ✅ All prerequisites met, authentication verified, proceeding with production migration.
