# Phase 2 Implementation Roadmap: Content & Data Quality Issues

## Objective
Address content quality, branding improvements, and data inconsistencies identified in Phase 2 of the Izerwaren Revamp 2.0 production preparation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Header branding enhanced with more prominent logo and "IZERWAREN INC." tagline
- [ ] About Us content updated with user-provided replacement copy (PENDING: Need user to provide copy)
- [x] Product data cleaned up (IZW-0751 title corrected from URL to proper name)
- [x] Language updated throughout site: "B2B" → "Pro Accounts", customer count "500+" → "1000+"

## Risks
- **Minimal Risk**: Content-focused changes with low technical complexity
- **Brand Consistency**: Ensure logo sizing doesn't break responsive layout
- **Copy Changes**: Verify all B2B references are updated consistently across all components

## Test Hooks
- Visual verification of logo prominence and tagline addition
- Review About Us page content matches user requirements
- Search for any remaining "B2B" references in codebase
- Verify customer count updated in hero section statistics
