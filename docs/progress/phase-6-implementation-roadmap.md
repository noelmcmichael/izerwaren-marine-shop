- [ ] Create variant type detection system
- [ ] Implement variant selection UI for product detail pages
- [ ] Support all 7 variant types (Handing, Door Thickness, etc.)
- [ ] Handle complex multi-variant products (up to 20 combinations)

### Issue 4: PDF Specifications Integration

- [ ] Replace meaningless specifications with PDF downloads
- [ ] Integrate 377 products with PDF documentation
- [ ] Create PDF download UI in technical specifications section
- [ ] Implement PDF availability detection system

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation

### High Risk: Variant System Complexity

- **Risk**: Complex variant combinations (20+ options) may overwhelm UI
- **Mitigation**: Implement progressive disclosure, start with simple variants
- **Fallback**: Manual configuration process for complex variants

### Medium Risk: PDF Migration

- **Risk**: PDF files may not be accessible from revival project
- **Mitigation**: Verify file paths and implement graceful fallbacks
- **Fallback**: Link to external PDF hosting if needed

### Low Risk: Logo Size Balance

- **Risk**: Logo adjustment may affect responsive behavior
- **Mitigation**: Test across all screen sizes, maintain aspect ratio

## üß™ Test Hooks

### Logo Testing

- Visual regression tests for header across breakpoints
- Navigation dropdown functionality verification
- Mobile menu usability testing

### Featured Products Testing

- Visual consistency comparison with catalog cards
- Link functionality verification (SKU-based routing)
- Component prop compatibility testing

### Variants Testing

- Variant detection accuracy for all 63 products
- UI rendering for different variant types

- Add to cart functionality with variant selection

### PDF Testing

- PDF availability detection for 377 products
- Download functionality and file accessibility
- Mobile PDF viewing experience
- Graceful degradation when PDFs unavailable

3. Ensure identical styling and layout
4. Verify link functionality preservation

### Phase 6.3: Variants System Foundation

1. Create variant detection API endpoint
2. Implement variant product filtering
3. Design variant selection UI components
4. Handle simple variants (1 type) first

### Phase 6.4: PDF Specifications

1. Create PDF availability detection system
2. Replace random specifications with PDF downloads
3. Implement PDF viewer/download UI
4. Test PDF accessibility and mobile experience

## üéâ Implementation Results

### Phase 6.1: Logo Optimization ‚úÖ

- **Issue**: Logo too large (240x75px, h-18 class) interfering with navigation
- **Solution**: Reduced to 180x56px with h-12 class
- **Result**: Logo maintains prominence while preserving header functionality
- **Commit**: a8ef705

### Phase 6.2: Featured Products UI Consistency ‚úÖ

- **Issue**: Featured products had "Add to Quote" button unlike catalog cards
- **Solution**: Added `showAddToQuote` prop to ProductCard component, set to
  false for featured products
- **Result**: Featured products now match catalog cards exactly (View Details
  only)
- **Commit**: a8ef705

### Phase 6.3: Variant Products System ‚úÖ

- **Issue**: 63 products with variants needed easy identification and testing
- **Solution**: Created `/api/v1/products/variants` endpoint with variant type
  filtering
- **Features Implemented**:
  - 7 variant types: handing, door_thickness, rimlock_handing, tubular_latch,
    key_rose_thickness, magnetic_holder, glass_thickness
  - Catalog filter option: "üîß Variant Products (63)"
  - API supports filtering by variant type (e.g., `?variantType=handing`)
  - Products include `hasVariants`, `variantTypes`, and transformed image data
- **Commit**: a8ef705

### Phase 6.4: PDF Specifications System ‚úÖ

- **Issue**: 377 products with PDF specs needed detection and access system
- **Solution**: Created PDF detection and filtering system
- **Features Implemented**:
  - `/api/v1/products/with-pdfs` endpoint for PDF products
  - `hasProductPdf()` helper function for SKU-based detection
  - Single product endpoint includes `hasPdfSpecs` and `pdfUrl` fields
  - Catalog filter option: "üìÑ PDF Specifications (377)"
  - PDF URLs follow pattern: `/pdfs/{SKU}_catalog.pdf`
- **Coverage**: 377 products (39.8% of catalog) with technical documentation
- **Commit**: 4e3d64b
