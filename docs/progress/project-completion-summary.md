### **Business Capability Assessment**

- **🟢 E-commerce MVP**: 100% Ready for immediate deployment
- **🟢 B2B RFQ System**: Integration points fully prepared
- **🟢 Shopify Integration**: Variant mapping structure complete
- **🟡 Enhanced UX**: Image galleries enhancement recommended

## 📋 Technical Decisions & Implementations

### **Schema Alignment Solutions**

- **Field Mapping**: `basePrice` → `price`, `displayOrder` → `sortOrder`
- **Variant SKU Format**: `IZW-####-CODE` (e.g., `IZW-0007-LHI`)
- **Uniqueness Handling**: SKU suffixes for variant differentiation
- **Boolean Conversion**: Proper handling of `isSearchable` specifications

### **Performance Optimizations**

- **Batch Processing**: 50 products per batch for memory efficiency
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for network resilience
- **State Persistence**: `.taskmaster/import-state.json` for resumability
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring with ETA calculations

### **Error Handling Strategy**

- **Network Failures**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Data Validation**: Schema compliance checks before import
- **Partial Failures**: Continue processing with detailed error logging
- **Recovery**: Resume from any interruption point
