# Task 26: Production Deployment Status Update

**Date**: 2025-01-30  
**Updated**: 2025-01-30 17:25 PST  
**Overall Status**: 75% COMPLETE - Ready for Monitoring & DNS Configuration  

## üéØ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Database Blocking Issue Resolved**

### **Critical Issue Resolution:**
The database tier upgrade was causing a 1.5+ hour blocking confirmation loop in `gcloud sql instances patch`. 

**Strategic Solution Implemented:**
