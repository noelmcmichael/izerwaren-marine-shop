- sharp: Image processing and optimization
- bull: Job queue for async processing
- node-cron: Scheduled sync tasks
```

### Migration Pipeline
```

  Variants   Validation   Rate Limit   Rollback     Logging
  Media      Optimization  Retry       Recovery     Monitoring
```

## Risk Mitigation

### API Rate Limiting
- **Shopify Limits**: 2 requests/second standard, 40 requests/second Plus
- **Mitigation**: Implement queue system with exponential backoff
- **Monitoring**: Track API usage and throttle accordingly

### Data Integrity
- **Risk**: Data corruption during migration
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive validation and rollback mechanisms
- **Testing**: Dry-run mode with detailed reporting

### Performance Optimization
- **Challenge**: 12,448 media files + 947 products
- **Solution**: Parallel processing with worker threads
- **Monitoring**: Progress tracking and ETA calculation

## Success Metrics
- **Migration Accuracy**: 100% data integrity verification
- **Performance**: Complete migration within 4-6 hours
- **Error Rate**: <1% with automatic retry recovery
