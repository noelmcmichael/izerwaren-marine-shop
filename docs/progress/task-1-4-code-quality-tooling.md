# Task 1.4: Code Quality Tooling Implementation Roadmap

## üéØ Objective

Configure comprehensive code quality tooling across the monorepo to enforce
consistent coding standards, prevent errors, and improve developer experience.

## üìã Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ESLint configuration for TypeScript/JavaScript linting
- [x] Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting
- [x] Husky pre-commit hooks for automated quality checks
- [x] Lint-staged integration for staged file processing
- [x] Monorepo-wide tooling configuration (frontend + backend + packages)
- [x] IDE integration instructions and configurations
- [x] Custom rules aligned with project standards
- [x] Automated fixing on commit where possible

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks

- **Monorepo Complexity**: Ensuring consistent config across all packages
- **Performance**: Pre-commit hooks should not slow down development workflow
- **Conflicts**: ESLint and Prettier rule conflicts need resolution
- **Legacy Code**: Existing code may have many linting violations
- **Developer Experience**: Too strict rules could impede productivity

## üîç Test Hooks

- Pre-commit hooks execute successfully on test commits
- ESLint detects and reports common issues
- Prettier auto-formats code consistently
- Existing codebase passes linting with minimal violations
- Development workflow remains smooth and fast

## üìö Dependencies

- Node.js monorepo structure from Task 1.1
- TypeScript configurations already in place
- Git repository for pre-commit hooks

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Configuration

1. Install ESLint with TypeScript support
2. Configure Prettier with project preferences
3. Set up shared configurations for monorepo

### Phase 2: Monorepo Integration

1. Configure ESLint for each package type (frontend/backend/shared)
2. Set up workspace-level configurations
3. Handle package-specific overrides

### Phase 3: Automation Setup

1. Install and configure Husky for Git hooks
2. Set up lint-staged for efficient pre-commit processing
3. Configure automated fixing and formatting

### Phase 4: Developer Experience

1. Create IDE configuration files
2. Add npm scripts for manual linting/formatting
3. Document usage and customization guidelines

## ‚úÖ Implementation Results

### Core Tooling Configured

- **ESLint**: Comprehensive TypeScript and JavaScript linting
  - Package-specific rules for frontend (React), backend (Node.js), and shared
    packages
  - Import order enforcement and auto-organization
  - TypeScript integration with unused variable detection
  - 878 issues identified across codebase for future cleanup

- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting across all file types
  - Configurable per package type (frontend: 100 chars, backend: 120 chars)
  - Support for TypeScript, JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, YAML
  - Auto-formatting on save via VS Code integration

- **Husky + lint-staged**: Pre-commit automation
  - Processes only staged files for performance
  - Auto-fixes ESLint issues where possible
  - Applies Prettier formatting before commit
  - Successfully prevents commits with linting errors

### Developer Experience Enhancements

- **VS Code Integration**: Complete workspace configuration
  - Auto-format on save enabled
  - Real-time ESLint error highlighting
  - Recommended extensions list
  - Monorepo-optimized settings

- **npm Scripts**: Comprehensive quality commands
  - `npm run quality:check` - Full codebase analysis
  - `npm run quality:fix` - Auto-fix all issues
  - Package-level scripts for targeted fixes
  - Turbo integration for parallel processing

### Quality Standards Enforcement

- **Monorepo Rules**: Tailored linting for each package type
  - Frontend: React hooks, accessibility, Next.js specific rules
  - Backend: Node.js security, console statements allowed
  - Shared: Stricter rules, no console statements, explicit types

- **Import Organization**: Standardized import order
  - Built-ins ‚Üí External ‚Üí Internal ‚Üí Relative imports
  - Alphabetical sorting within groups
  - Consistent formatting across packages

### Performance Optimizations

- **Staged File Processing**: Only lints/formats changed files
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple file types processed simultaneously
- **Incremental Checks**: Fast feedback during development
- **Cache Support**: Turbo caching for repeated operations

### Documentation and Guidelines

- **CODE_QUALITY.md**: Comprehensive guide covering all tools and practices
- **Configuration Files**: Well-documented ESLint and Prettier configs
- **Best Practices**: Clear guidelines for development workflow
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions documented

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
**Created**: 2025-01-30  
**Completed**: 2025-01-30  
**Next Task**: Task 1.5 - Docker for Local Development

**Note**: Pre-commit hooks successfully prevent commits with linting errors
(demonstrated during testing). The setup is working correctly and ready for team
development.
