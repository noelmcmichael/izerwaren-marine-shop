# Phase 7.1: Product Details Enhancement

## Implementation Roadmap

### Objective

Enhance product detail pages with proper dynamic content, multiple image
galleries, PDF product sheets, and improved shopping cart visibility.

### Issues Identified

1. **Static Product Display**: All product detail pages show "Strike Plate
   Short" instead of actual product
2. **Single Image Display**: Only showing primary image, not all available
   product images
3. **Missing PDF Sheets**: Product technical spec PDFs not accessible
4. **Cart Visibility**: Shopping cart items not clearly visible to user

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Product detail pages dynamically load correct product based on URL/ID
2. Image gallery displays all available product images with navigation
3. PDF product sheets accessible and viewable from product details
4. Shopping cart shows clear item count and mini-cart functionality
5. Responsive design maintains functionality across devices

### Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Dynamic routing breaking existing navigation
  - **Mitigation**: Test with multiple product IDs and maintain fallbacks
- **Risk**: Large image galleries affecting performance
  - **Mitigation**: Implement lazy loading and image optimization
- **Risk**: PDF accessibility and viewing experience
  - **Mitigation**: Provide both download and inline viewing options

### Test Hooks

1. **Dynamic Product Loading**: Test multiple product IDs and SKUs
2. **Image Gallery**: Navigate through all available images
3. **PDF Integration**: Verify PDF accessibility and viewing
4. **Cart Functionality**: Add items and verify cart state
5. **Performance**: Measure page load times with multiple images
