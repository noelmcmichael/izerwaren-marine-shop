# Phase 4.1: Bulk Ordering Interface - Implementation Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Create a B2B bulk ordering interface that allows dealers to efficiently add multiple products with quantities, view tier-based pricing, and submit orders through Shopify.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] **Product Search & Add**: Quick product lookup with autocomplete/search
- [ ] **Bulk Cart Management**: Add multiple products with quantities in a table/list view
- [ ] **Real-time Pricing**: Display tier-based pricing for each line item and totals
- [ ] **Order Validation**: Minimum order requirements, inventory checks, tier restrictions
- [ ] **Shopify Integration**: Submit bulk orders to Shopify with proper customer attribution

### User Experience
- [ ] **Quick Add Interface**: Barcode/SKU input, recent products, favorites
- [ ] **Quantity Controls**: Stepper inputs, copy/paste from spreadsheets
- [ ] **Pricing Transparency**: Show unit price, quantity discounts, tier savings
- [ ] **Order Summary**: Line items, subtotals, taxes, shipping estimates
- [ ] **Save & Resume**: Save draft orders for later completion

### Business Logic
- [ ] **Tier-based Discounts**: Apply STANDARD (0%), PREMIUM (10%), ENTERPRISE (15%)
- [ ] **Quantity Breaks**: Volume pricing tiers per product
- [ ] **Minimum Orders**: Tier-specific minimum order amounts
- [ ] **Credit Limits**: Enterprise customer credit limit validation

## ðŸš¨ Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Shopify API Rate Limits**: Implement request batching and queueing
