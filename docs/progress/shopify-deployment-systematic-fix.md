# Shopify Integration - Systematic Deployment Fix

## üö® Current Problem Analysis

**Status**: Production shows 947 mock products instead of 956 real Shopify products
**Root Cause**: Frontend components have localhost URLs baked into production build
**Evidence**: Console shows `localhost:3001/health` requests failing

## üîç Systematic Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Diagnose the Exact Problem
1. **Audit all API URL configurations** in the codebase
2. **Check what's actually deployed** to production 
3. **Identify disconnect** between working API and frontend consumption
4. **Map the complete data flow** from Shopify ‚Üí API ‚Üí Frontend

### Phase 2: Fix Configuration Issues
1. **Eliminate all localhost references** from production builds
2. **Centralize API URL configuration** in one place
3. **Ensure build-time vs runtime configs** are correct
4. **Verify environment variable precedence**

### Phase 3: Deploy with Verification
1. **Test locally first** with production-like setup
2. **Deploy with systematic verification** at each step
3. **Monitor frontend ‚Üí API communication** in production
4. **Confirm real Shopify data** end-to-end

## üéØ Success Criteria
- [x] API endpoints work (already verified)
- [ ] Frontend shows 956 real Shopify products
- [ ] No localhost references in production
- [ ] Categories load properly
- [ ] Real product data displays correctly

## üöÄ Implementation Strategy
1. **Fix first, deploy once** - no iterative fixes in production
2. **Test everything locally** before deployment
3. **Systematic verification** at each step
4. **Single, complete deployment** that works

## üîß Immediate Action Items
1. Find and fix all localhost API references
2. Verify frontend actually uses resilient-products service
3. Test complete flow locally
4. Deploy with confidence
