# Production Fixes Implementation Roadmap

## Objective

Fix two critical production issues:

1. **Product Pagination**: Access all ~956 Shopify products instead of 250 limit
2. **Missing Routes**: Resolve 404 errors for `/account` and other missing pages

## Acceptance Criteria

### Product Pagination

- [x] API returns all available products from Shopify store (952 products)
- [x] Frontend pagination handles large product sets efficiently
- [x] Performance remains acceptable (< 3s initial load)
- [x] Categories and search work with full product set

### Missing Routes

- [x] `/account` route exists and functions
- [x] Major navigation 404 errors resolved
- [x] Navigation links work correctly
- [x] Authentication flow placeholder implemented

## Risks

### Product Pagination

- **Performance Risk**: Loading 956 products might be slow
- **API Limits**: Shopify GraphQL rate limiting
- **Memory Usage**: Large product arrays in browser

### Missing Routes

- **Authentication**: Account page might need login system
- **Database Dependencies**: Some removed routes may be needed
- **Navigation UX**: Broken links affect user experience

## Test Hooks

### Product Pagination

```bash
# Test API can fetch all products
curl "https://izerwaren.mcmichaelbuild.com/api/products?limit=1000"

# Test pagination works
curl "https://izerwaren.mcmichaelbuild.com/api/products?page=2&limit=50"

# Test performance
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" "https://izerwaren.mcmichaelbuild.com/api/products"
```

### Missing Routes

```bash
# Test account route exists
curl -I "https://izerwaren.mcmichaelbuild.com/account"

# Check console for 404s
# Browse site and monitor browser devtools
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Product Pagination (High Priority)

1. Replace `fetchAll(250)` with GraphQL pagination
2. Implement server-side pagination in API
3. Update frontend to handle larger datasets
4. Test performance and optimize

### Phase 2: Fix Missing Routes (Medium Priority)

1. Create minimal `/account` page
2. Identify other missing routes from console logs
3. Add basic route stubs to prevent 404s
4. Implement proper authentication if needed

## Notes

- Focus on Shopify integration first - core business functionality
- Account features can be minimal initially
- Monitor performance closely with full product set

### Production Verification

```bash
# Product count verified
curl "https://izerwaren.mcmichaelbuild.com/api/products?limit=500"
# Returns: 952 total products

# Account page verified
curl -I "https://izerwaren.mcmichaelbuild.com/account"
# Returns: HTTP/2 200 OK

# Catalog display verified
# Shows: "Showing 1-20 of 952 products"
```

**Both production issues successfully resolved!** ðŸŽ‰
