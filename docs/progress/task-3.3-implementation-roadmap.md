# Task 3.3: Error Monitoring and Alerting Implementation Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Implement comprehensive error monitoring and alerting system using Sentry to capture unhandled exceptions, track errors with correlation IDs, and provide automated alerts for critical failures.

## ðŸ“‹ Acceptance Criteria

### Core Requirements
- [ ] Sentry integration for error tracking
- [ ] Correlation ID propagation to error reports
- [ ] React Error Boundaries for client-side error handling
- [ ] Server-side error monitoring for API routes
- [ ] Automated alerting configuration
- [ ] Error categorization and severity levels
- [ ] Integration with existing logging infrastructure

### Technical Specifications
- [ ] Sentry SDK configuration for Next.js (client + server)
- [ ] Custom error reporting with context enrichment
- [ ] Error boundary components for graceful degradation
- [ ] Alert rules for critical errors and error rate thresholds
- [ ] Release tracking for error attribution
- [ ] Performance monitoring integration
- [ ] User feedback collection on errors

### Integration Points
- [ ] Correlation ID from existing logging system
- [ ] Health check error reporting
- [ ] Production deployment integration
- [ ] Development environment error tracking

## ðŸš¨ Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks
1. **Bundle Size Impact**
   - Risk: Sentry SDK adding significant client bundle size
   - Mitigation: Use tree-shaking, minimal SDK configuration, lazy loading

2. **Error Noise**
   - Risk: Too many low-priority errors overwhelming alerts
   - Mitigation: Proper error filtering, rate limiting, severity classification

3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - Risk: Accidentally logging sensitive user data
   - Mitigation: Sentry data scrubbing, custom filters, PII redaction

### Operational Risks
1. **Alert Fatigue**
   - Risk: Too many notifications reducing response effectiveness
   - Mitigation: Thoughtful alert rules, escalation policies, snoozing capabilities

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Risk: Error reporting affecting application performance
   - Mitigation: Async error reporting, rate limiting, performance budgets

## ðŸ§ª Test Hooks

### Unit Tests
- Error boundary error handling
- Sentry configuration validation
- Custom error enrichment functions

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end error reporting flow
- Correlation ID propagation through error reports
- Alert delivery verification

### Smoke Tests
- Intentional error triggering
- Alert rule verification
- Error dashboard accessibility

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

### Error Tracking
- 100% error capture rate for unhandled exceptions
- Correlation ID present in all error reports
- Error resolution time reduction by 50%

### Alert Effectiveness
- <5% false positive alert rate
- <2 minute alert delivery time for critical errors
- 100% alert rule coverage for critical paths

### Developer Experience
- Error context includes request information
- Sourcemap integration for readable stack traces
- Clear error categorization and prioritization

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Sentry Integration
1. Install and configure Sentry SDK
2. Set up server-side error tracking
3. Configure client-side error tracking
4. Test basic error reporting

### Phase 2: Context Enrichment
1. Integrate correlation IDs
2. Add request context to errors
3. Configure user context tracking
4. Set up release tracking

### Phase 3: Error Boundaries & Recovery
1. Implement React Error Boundaries
2. Add graceful degradation strategies
3. User feedback collection
4. Error recovery flows

### Phase 4: Alerting & Monitoring
1. Configure alert rules
2. Set up notification channels
3. Create error dashboards
4. Test escalation procedures

### Phase 5: Production Optimization
1. Performance impact assessment
2. Error filtering refinement
3. Alert threshold tuning
4. Documentation and runbooks

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
1. Start with Sentry account setup and SDK installation
2. Configure basic error reporting
3. Integrate with existing correlation ID system
4. Implement error boundaries
5. Set up initial alert rules

## ðŸ“š Dependencies
- Existing correlation ID system (Task 3.2) âœ…
- Health check endpoints (Task 3.1) âœ…
- GCP project configuration for Sentry DSN
- Team communication channels for alerts
