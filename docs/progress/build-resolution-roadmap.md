# Implementation Roadmap: Build Resolution & Deployment

## Objective
Resolve the Next.js 14 build issues preventing deployment of the Task 10 enhanced marine hardware platform, enabling live data integration and business demo preparation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Identify root cause of React useContext errors during static generation
- [ ] Eliminate build errors for core pages (home, catalog, product detail)
- [ ] Successfully create production build and Docker container
- [ ] Deploy working version to https://izerwaren.mcmichaelbuild.com
- [ ] Restore and test Task 10 specification display system
- [ ] Enable business owner demo readiness

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause Identified
1. **Sentry Integration Conflicts**: BrowserTracing and context usage during SSR
2. **next-seo Legacy Usage**: DefaultSeo in App Router causing context errors
3. **Viewport Metadata**: Next.js 14 requires separate viewport export
4. **Context Provider SSR Issues**: React hooks being called during static generation

### Build Error Pattern
- Error digest: `510900117` / `1620352502` / `154415` (consistent)
- Location: Server chunks during static page generation
- Affected: All pages using React context or client components during SSR

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Deployment Timeline**: Each iteration cycle takes 2-3 minutes for full build
- **Component Dependencies**: Complex component tree makes isolation difficult
- **Data Loss**: Risk of losing Task 10 implementation during fixes

### Medium Risk  
- **SEO Impact**: Removing next-seo temporarily affects metadata richness
- **Admin Functionality**: Admin pages temporarily disabled for build resolution

### Low Risk
- **Test Pages**: Already isolated and can be removed permanently
- **Sentry Monitoring**: Can be re-enabled after build resolution

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Minimal Working Build ✅
- [x] Remove problematic test pages
- [x] Disable Sentry integration temporarily  
- [x] Fix viewport metadata export
- [x] Remove next-seo from layout

### Phase 2: Component Isolation (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Identify specific component causing context errors
- [ ] Add force-dynamic exports to client pages
- [ ] Create wrapper components for problematic providers
- [ ] Test build with incremental page restoration

### Phase 3: Provider Debugging
- [ ] Isolate each provider (Auth, Cart, Toast, etc.)
- [ ] Create SSR-safe wrapper implementations
- [ ] Add error boundaries around context consumers

### Phase 4: Build Optimization
- [ ] Re-enable static generation for pages that support it
- [ ] Optimize build configuration for production
- [ ] Create staging deployment for testing

## Current Status

### Working Solutions ✅
- Minimal build (layout + simple page) builds successfully
- Sentry temporarily disabled to eliminate BrowserTracing issues
- Viewport metadata properly exported per Next.js 14 requirements

### In Progress 🔄
- Systematic component restoration to identify problematic providers
- Force-dynamic exports added to admin and client pages
- Provider wrapper creation for SSR compatibility

### Blocked ❌
- Full application build with all features
- Task 10 specification system testing
- Production deployment to live domain

## Implementation Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Create SSR-Safe Provider Wrapper**
   ```tsx
   // Create providers/SSRProvider.tsx
   'use client';
   import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
   
   const ClientProviders = dynamic(() => 
     import('./index').then(mod => ({ default: mod.Providers })), 
     { ssr: false }
   );
   ```

2. **Add Error Boundaries**
   ```tsx
   // Wrap each page component with error boundary
   export default function Page() {
     return (
       <ErrorBoundary fallback={<PageError />}>
         <PageContent />
       </ErrorBoundary>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Isolate Context Usage**
   - Move all useContext calls to client components only
   - Create server-compatible alternatives for SSR

### Test Hooks
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Home page renders correctly
- [ ] Product catalog functions
- [ ] Task 10 specification display works
- [ ] Docker container builds successfully
- [ ] Deployment pipeline executes

## Dependencies
- Next.js 14.2.31 App Router compatibility
- React 18.2.0 server components
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 styling
- Framer Motion 12.23.12 animations

## Success Metrics
1. **Build Time**: < 5 minutes for full production build
2. **Page Load**: < 2 seconds for core pages
3. **Error Rate**: 0 build errors, 0 runtime errors on core pages
4. **Feature Parity**: All Task 10 features functional post-deployment

## Rollback Plan
If resolution extends beyond reasonable timeframe:
1. Revert to last known working build configuration
2. Deploy subset of features without Task 10 enhancements
3. Schedule separate Task 10 integration phase
4. Prioritize business demo with existing features

**Next Session Focus**: Complete Phase 2 component isolation and achieve working production build for core e-commerce functionality.
