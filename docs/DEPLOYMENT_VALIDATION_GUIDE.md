# Deployment Validation and Smoke Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the comprehensive deployment validation framework implemented for the Izerwaren Revamp 2.0 project. The framework provides automated testing for deployment validation, smoke testing, and production readiness verification.

### Test Categories

#### 1. Smoke Tests
**Purpose**: Fast validation of critical functionality
- Basic connectivity and page loading
- Health check endpoint validation
- Core navigation and UI elements
- Authentication flow (if applicable)

**Execution Time**: < 2 minutes
**Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox
**Mobile**: iPhone 13 simulation

#### 2. Integration Tests  
**Purpose**: External service connectivity validation
- Shopify API integration
- Backend API connectivity
- CDN and static asset loading
- Third-party service health

**Execution Time**: < 5 minutes
**Dependencies**: Smoke tests must pass

#### 3. Deployment Validation
**Purpose**: Post-deployment production readiness
- Regression detection
- Performance baseline validation
- Security header verification
- Production configuration checks

**Execution Time**: < 10 minutes
**Timeout**: Extended for thorough validation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`: Target URL for testing
- `PLAYWRIGHT_ENV`: Environment context (local/staging/production)
- `NODE_ENV`: Node environment setting
- `TEST_CORRELATION_ID`: Auto-generated correlation ID for traceability

### Playwright Configuration
```typescript
// Base configuration for all test types
use: {
  baseURL: process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
  trace: 'on-first-retry',
  screenshot: 'only-on-failure', 
  video: 'retain-on-failure',
  actionTimeout: 15000,
  navigationTimeout: 30000,
}
```

### Test Projects
- **smoke-tests-chromium**: Chrome-based smoke tests
- **smoke-tests-firefox**: Firefox-based smoke tests  
- **integration-tests**: External service validation
- **deployment-validation**: Post-deployment checks
- **mobile-smoke**: Mobile compatibility validation

## Usage

### Available npm Scripts
```bash
# Run all smoke tests
npm run test:smoke

# Run basic connectivity test (simple config)
npm run test:smoke:basic

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run deployment validation
npm run test:deployment

# Run mobile tests
npm run test:mobile

# Run critical path tests (smoke + deployment)
npm run test:critical

# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Debug mode
npm run test:debug

# View test report
npm run test:report
```

### CI/CD Integration Scripts

#### `scripts/run-deployment-tests.sh`
Main test execution script with support for:
- Test type selection (smoke, integration, deployment, critical, all)
- Environment-aware configuration
- Parallel execution and retry logic
- Error reporting integration

```bash
# Usage examples
./scripts/run-deployment-tests.sh smoke
./scripts/run-deployment-tests.sh critical https://staging.example.com
./scripts/run-deployment-tests.sh all https://production.example.com
```

#### `scripts/deployment-validation.sh`
Cloud Build integration script:
- Service URL determination from Cloud Run
- Automated deployment validation
- Notification system integration
- Production traffic routing logic

```bash
# Usage in Cloud Build
./scripts/deployment-validation.sh $PROJECT_ID $SERVICE_NAME $REGION
```

## Error Monitoring Integration

### Test Reporter
The `TestReporter` class integrates test failures with the production error monitoring system:

```typescript
// Automatic error reporting for test failures
const reporter = new TestReporter('test-category');
await reporter.reportError(error, {
  component: 'deployment-validation',
  operation: 'smoke-test',
  metadata: { testName, environment, correlationId },
  severity: 'critical'
});
```

### Correlation IDs
Every test run generates a correlation ID for traceability:
- Global setup creates master correlation ID
- Individual tests inherit and extend correlation ID
- Error reports include correlation ID for debugging
- Test artifacts linked via correlation ID

## Test Results and Artifacts

### Generated Artifacts
- **Screenshots**: Captured on test failure
- **Videos**: Full browser recordings on failure
- **Traces**: Playwright traces for detailed debugging
- **HTML Reports**: Comprehensive test result visualization
- **JSON/JUnit Reports**: Machine-readable test results

### Result Interpretation

#### Success Indicators
- ✅ All smoke tests pass (application accessible)
- ✅ Health checks return healthy/degraded status
- ✅ Core functionality verified
- ✅ Performance within acceptable ranges

#### Warning Indicators  
- ⚠️ System in degraded state (some services down)
- ⚠️ Performance approaching thresholds
- ⚠️ Non-critical external services unavailable

#### Failure Indicators
- ❌ Application not accessible (503/500 errors)
- ❌ Health checks fail completely
- ❌ Core functionality broken
- ❌ Critical external services unavailable

## Production Deployment Process

### Pre-Deployment
1. Run smoke tests against staging environment
2. Validate health check endpoints
3. Verify external service connectivity
4. Check performance baselines

### Post-Deployment
1. Automated deployment validation via Cloud Build
2. Smoke test execution against production URL
3. Health check verification
4. Integration test validation
5. Performance regression detection

### Rollback Triggers
Tests automatically trigger rollback consideration if:
- Health checks return "unhealthy" status
- Core functionality smoke tests fail
- Critical external services unavailable
- Performance degrades beyond thresholds

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Test Failure Notifications
- Critical test failures reported to error monitoring
- Slack/email notifications for deployment validation
- Dashboard integration for real-time status
- Correlation IDs for rapid issue resolution

### Metrics Tracked
- Test execution time and success rate
- Application response times
- Health check status changes
- External service availability
- Error rates and patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Framework Issues
```bash
# Verify Playwright installation
npx playwright install

# Check configuration
npm run test:smoke:basic

# Debug mode for detailed output
npm run test:debug
```

#### Environment Issues
```bash
# Verify environment variables
echo $PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL
echo $NODE_ENV

# Test basic connectivity
curl -I $PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL/api/health
```

#### CI/CD Issues
```bash
# Check Cloud Build logs
gcloud builds log $BUILD_ID

# Verify service deployment
gcloud run services describe $SERVICE_NAME --region=$REGION
```

### Debug Information
- Test artifacts stored in `test-results/` directory
- Correlation IDs in test output for error tracking
- Detailed error context in failure reports
- Video recordings for visual debugging

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Performance Testing**: Load testing integration
2. **Security Testing**: Automated security scans
3. **Cross-Browser**: Extended browser coverage
4. **API Testing**: Dedicated API endpoint validation
5. **Database Testing**: Data integrity verification

### Configuration Extensions
1. **Environment-Specific**: Per-environment test configurations
2. **Conditional Testing**: Feature flag-based test execution
3. **Parallel Scaling**: Dynamic worker scaling
4. **Test Data Management**: Automated test data setup/teardown
