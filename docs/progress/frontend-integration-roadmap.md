# Frontend Integration Roadmap - Shopify CDN Image Migration

## Objective
Integrate Shopify CDN images into the Next.js frontend and implement core B2B functionality following the successful migration of 11,920 images to Shopify CDN.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Shopify Image Integration âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Image Component Migration**: Update ProductCard.tsx to use Shopify CDN URLs
- [x] **Image Gallery Component**: Create new gallery component for product detail pages  
- [x] **Shopify Image Utils**: Create utility functions for URL transformation and optimization
- [x] **Fallback Strategy**: Implement graceful fallback for missing images
- [x] **Performance Testing**: Validate image loading performance vs previous local images

### Phase 2: Data Layer Enhancement âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **API Client Setup**: Configure React Query for Shopify API integration
- [x] **SWR Integration**: Implement SWR for local API data fetching
- [x] **Product Data Service**: Create service layer for hybrid Shopify + PostgreSQL data
- [x] **Image Service**: Create service for image URL resolution and optimization
- [x] **Caching Strategy**: Implement proper caching for product and image data

### Phase 3: B2B Authentication System
- [ ] **Customer Tier Detection**: Implement customer account type detection
- [ ] **Pricing Logic**: Display tier-based pricing from PostgreSQL
- [ ] **Authentication Middleware**: Secure B2B-only routes and features
- [ ] **Customer Dashboard**: Basic customer account management interface

### Phase 4: Enhanced B2B Features
- [ ] **Bulk Ordering Interface**: Quantity-based ordering for B2B customers
- [ ] **Quote Request System**: Allow customers to request custom quotes
- [ ] **Order History**: Display previous orders and reorder functionality
- [ ] **PDF Downloads**: Secure access to technical specifications and manuals

## Risks & Mitigation

### High Risk
- **Image Loading Performance**: Shopify CDN may be slower than local images
  - *Mitigation*: Implement Next.js Image optimization, lazy loading, and caching
- **API Rate Limits**: Shopify Storefront API has usage limits
  - *Mitigation*: Implement proper caching, SWR for local data where possible

### Medium Risk  
- **Authentication Complexity**: B2B customer tier logic integration
  - *Mitigation*: Start with simple role-based access, expand incrementally
- **Data Synchronization**: Shopify + PostgreSQL data consistency
  - *Mitigation*: Clear data boundaries, PostgreSQL as source of truth for pricing/specs

### Low Risk
- **Image URL Format Changes**: Shopify CDN URLs structure
  - *Mitigation*: Utility functions abstract URL generation logic

## Test Hooks

### Automated Tests
- [ ] **Image Component Tests**: React Testing Library for image rendering
- [ ] **API Service Tests**: Mock Shopify API responses  
- [ ] **Authentication Tests**: Customer tier detection logic
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse scores for image loading

### Manual Testing
- [ ] **Cross-browser Image Loading**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Image galleries on mobile devices
- [ ] **B2B Workflow**: Complete customer login â†’ browse â†’ quote process
- [ ] **Fallback Scenarios**: Network issues, missing images

## Implementation Phases

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Install Dependencies** âœ… - SWR, React Query installed
2. **Create Image Utilities** - Shopify URL transformation functions
3. **Update ProductCard Component** - Switch to Shopify CDN URLs
4. **Test Image Loading** - Validate performance and fallbacks

### Short-term (1-2 days)
1. **Image Gallery Component** - Multi-image product view
2. **API Client Setup** - React Query configuration
3. **Product Detail Enhancement** - Full Shopify image integration
4. **Basic Authentication** - Customer tier detection

### Medium-term (2-3 days)  
1. **B2B Pricing System** - PostgreSQL pricing integration
2. **Bulk Ordering Interface** - Quantity-based B2B features
3. **Customer Dashboard** - Account management
4. **Quote Request System** - Custom pricing requests

## Current Project State

### Database âœ… COMPLETED
- **Products**: 947 products migrated to Shopify + PostgreSQL specs  
- **Images**: 11,920 images on Shopify CDN (100% success rate)
- **Performance**: 137.2 images/minute migration completed

### Frontend âœ… PHASE 1-2 COMPLETED  
- **Dependencies**: TailwindCSS âœ…, SWR âœ…, React Query âœ…
- **Image Integration**: Shopify CDN optimization âœ…
- **Components**: ProductCard, ImageGallery, ShopifyImage âœ…
- **Data Layer**: Service layer with React Query/SWR âœ…
- **Testing**: Real Shopify CDN URLs validated âœ…

### Backend âœ… STABLE
- **Shopify Integration**: Proven GraphQL Admin API connection
- **Database Schema**: Product images table with Shopify URLs
- **Services**: Staged media upload and URL processing services

## Success Metrics
- **Image Load Time**: < 2s for product galleries
- **API Response Time**: < 500ms for product data
- **CDN Cache Hit Rate**: > 90% for product images  
- **Mobile Performance**: Lighthouse score > 85
- **B2B Conversion**: Successful quote request workflow

## Next Action
Continue with Phase 3: B2B Authentication System implementation.
