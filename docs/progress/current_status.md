# Current Project Status - Izerwaren 2.0

**Updated**: 2025-01-30  
**Environment**: Local Development Ready  
**Build Status**: ✅ Production Ready

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation

- ✅ Next.js 14 TypeScript application with App Router
- ✅ Prisma 5 ORM with PostgreSQL schema (8 tables)
- ✅ Docker configuration for Cloud Run deployment
- ✅ Blue/green deployment pipeline with health checks
- ✅ Project constitution (`rules.md`) and governance (ADR-000)

### Phase 2: Data Architecture & APIs

- ✅ Shopify Admin GraphQL client with rate limiting
- ✅ Firebase Admin SDK integration for authentication
- ✅ Comprehensive Prisma utilities for all data operations
- ✅ API endpoints: `/api/admin/*`, `/api/health`
- ✅ Product sync architecture and audit logging

### Phase 3: Admin Portal Interface

- ✅ Firebase Auth integration with protected routes
- ✅ Complete admin dashboard with stats and monitoring
- ✅ Dealer management (CRUD, search, tier assignment)
- ✅ Sync status monitoring with manual trigger capability
- ✅ Responsive design with mobile navigation

### Phase 4: Environment Setup (**Just Completed**)

- ✅ Local PostgreSQL database (`izerwaren_dev`) configured
- ✅ Database schema deployed (8 tables, all relationships)
- ✅ Sample data seeded (3 dealers, 2 products, pricing, RFQ)
- ✅ Environment validation script (`npm run test:env`)
- ✅ Comprehensive setup documentation (`docs/SETUP.md`)

## 🧠 Architecture Summary

**Data Flow**: JSON feed → Shopify Admin API → Local shadow tables → Admin
interface  
**Authentication**: Firebase Auth (admin/dealers) + Shopify Customer sessions
(public)  
**Pricing**: Shopify base + Cloud SQL tier overrides  
**Orders**: RFQ workflow → admin review → Shopify order creation

## 🎯 Current Status

### What Works Right Now

```bash
# Environment validation
npm run test:env          # ✅ Database + environment check

# Application
npm run build            # ✅ Builds successfully for production
npm run dev              # ✅ Starts dev server (external services optional)

# Database operations
npm run db:seed          # ✅ Populates sample data
npm run db:push          # ✅ Deploys schema changes
```

### Ready for Testing

- **Database operations**: All CRUD via Prisma working
- **Admin interface**: All UI components functional (pending auth setup)
- **API endpoints**: Health checks, admin routes implemented
- **Docker build**: Production image builds successfully

## 🔧 External Service Configuration Needed

The application core is complete, but requires these external services for full
functionality:

### 1. Firebase Authentication (Required for Admin Portal)

- **Purpose**: Admin login and dealer session management
- **Setup time**: ~30 minutes
- **Impact**: Enables admin portal access and dealer authentication

### 2. Shopify Development Store (Required for Product/Order Management)

- **Purpose**: Product catalog, pricing, order processing
- **Setup time**: ~45 minutes
- **Impact**: Enables product sync, pricing, and order workflows

### 3. Optional Enhancements

- **Cloud SQL**: Production database (dev uses local PostgreSQL)
- **GCP Secret Manager**: Secure credential storage
- **Staging environment**: Separate Cloud Run instance

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps (Pick One)

### Option A: Complete Local Development Setup

**Goal**: Full functional local environment  
**Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Steps**: Configure Firebase + Shopify per `docs/SETUP.md`  
**Outcome**: End-to-end testing capability

### Option B: Production Environment Setup

**Goal**: Deploy to Google Cloud Platform  
**Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Steps**: Provision Cloud SQL, Secret Manager, Cloud Run  
**Outcome**: Live staging environment

### Option C: Data Migration Focus

**Goal**: Import existing SKU/dealer data  
**Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Steps**: Process 1050 SKU JSON feed, import dealer records  
**Outcome**: Production-ready data set

### Option D: Feature Development

**Goal**: Expand functionality (pricing UI, RFQ workflow, public catalog)  
**Time**: 2-4 hours per feature  
**Steps**: Choose from established roadmap priorities  
**Outcome**: Enhanced business capabilities

## 🎉 Project Health Indicators

- **Build Status**: ✅ Green (production builds successful)
- **Test Coverage**: ⚠️ Framework ready (needs test implementation)
- **Documentation**: ✅ Complete (constitution, ADRs, setup guides)
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Current (14 vulnerabilities noted, non-critical)
- **Git Hygiene**: ✅ Clean (conventional commits, proper branching)

## 💡 Recommended Path Forward

**For immediate productivity**: Choose **Option A** (Complete Local Setup)

- Fastest path to full functionality testing
- Enables complete feature development workflow
- Low risk, high learning value
- Sets foundation for production deployment

**For production readiness**: Choose **Option B** (Production Environment)

- Establishes production infrastructure
- Enables stakeholder demonstrations
- Validates deployment pipeline
- Higher complexity but greater business impact

The choice depends on whether the priority is **development velocity** (Option
A) or **deployment readiness** (Option B).
