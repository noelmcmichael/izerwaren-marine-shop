## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```

├── comparison/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── ComparisonBar.tsx        # Floating comparison bar
│   │   ├── ComparisonTable.tsx      # Side-by-side comparison view
│   │   ├── ComparisonSelector.tsx   # Add/remove controls
│   │   └── SpecificationDiff.tsx    # Highlight differences
│   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── useComparison.tsx        # Comparison state management
│   │   └── useComparisonAnalytics.tsx
│   └── page.tsx                     # Comparison page
├── components/
│   ├── RecentlyViewed.tsx           # Recently viewed carousel
│   └── ProductCard.tsx              # Enhanced with comparison controls
└── hooks/
    ├── useRecentlyViewed.tsx        # localStorage tracking
    └── useProductActions.tsx        # Cart/quote actions
```

### Data Models
```typescript
// Comparison state
interface ComparisonState {
  products: ProductSummary[];
  maxProducts: number;
  isOpen: boolean;
}

// Recently viewed tracking
interface RecentlyViewedItem {
  productId: string;
  viewedAt: Date;
  title: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  price?: number;
}

// Product action results
interface ProductActionResult {
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  actionType: 'cart' | 'quote';
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- **localStorage optimization**: Limit recently viewed to 20 items
- **Lazy loading**: Load comparison data only when needed
- **Memoization**: React.memo for comparison components
- **Debounced actions**: Prevent rapid add/remove operations

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (2-3 hours)
1. **State Management**: Implement comparison and recently viewed hooks
2. **Data Persistence**: localStorage utilities for both features
3. **Type Definitions**: TypeScript interfaces for all components
4. **Basic Components**: Skeleton components for rapid iteration

### Phase 2: Product Comparison (3-4 hours)
1. **Comparison Bar**: Floating UI with product selection indicators
2. **Comparison Table**: Technical specifications side-by-side display
3. **Difference Highlighting**: Visual indicators for spec variations
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive comparison interface

### Phase 3: Recently Viewed (2-3 hours)
1. **View Tracking**: Automatic product view detection and storage
2. **Carousel Component**: Recently viewed products display
3. **Integration**: Add carousel to product listing pages
4. **Privacy Controls**: Clear history functionality

### Phase 4: Integration & Actions (2-3 hours)
1. **Cart Integration**: Connect with existing Shopify cart system
2. **Quote System**: B2B quote request functionality
3. **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for all actions
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states

### Phase 5: Polish & Testing (1-2 hours)
1. **i18n Integration**: Multi-language support
2. **Analytics**: Track user interactions
3. **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting and memoization
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **localStorage limits**: Implement data cleanup and error handling
- **Mobile performance**: Optimize comparison table for small screens
- **State synchronization**: Ensure consistency across components
- **Memory leaks**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and timers

### UX Risks
- **Comparison complexity**: Limit to 4 products to avoid overwhelming UI
- **Mobile usability**: Simplified comparison view for mobile devices
- **Performance perception**: Loading states for all async operations

### Integration Risks
- **Cart system conflicts**: Test thoroughly with existing Shopify integration
- **Search result compatibility**: Ensure comparison works with all product types
- **Analytics conflicts**: Coordinate with existing search analytics

## Test Hooks

### Unit Tests
- [ ] `useComparison` hook functionality
- [ ] `useRecentlyViewed` localStorage operations
- [ ] `ComparisonTable` specification rendering
- [ ] `RecentlyViewed` carousel behavior

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Comparison workflow from search to comparison page
- [ ] Recently viewed tracking across page navigation
- [ ] Cart integration with toast notifications
- [ ] Quote request functionality

### E2E Tests
- [ ] Complete comparison workflow
- [ ] Mobile comparison experience
- [ ] Recently viewed persistence across sessions
- [ ] Multi-language functionality

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **react-hot-toast**: Toast notifications (already in project)
- **framer-motion**: Smooth animations for floating bar
- **date-fns**: Date utilities for recently viewed timestamps

### Internal Dependencies
- **Search components**: Reuse SearchResults and ProductCard components
- **Product types**: Leverage existing ProductSummary interfaces
- **i18n system**: Integrate with existing next-intl setup
- **Analytics**: Extend existing search analytics system

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- **Comparison usage**: Track comparison page visits and interactions
- **Recently viewed engagement**: Click-through rate from recently viewed carousel
- **Conversion impact**: Measure cart additions from comparison/recently viewed

### Technical Performance
- **Page load impact**: Ensure <100ms additional load time
- **Mobile experience**: Maintain Core Web Vitals scores
- **Error rates**: <1% error rate for comparison/recently viewed operations

### Business Impact
- **B2B engagement**: Increased session duration and page views
- **Quote requests**: Track quote generation from comparison feature
- **Product discovery**: Improved product exploration through recently viewed
