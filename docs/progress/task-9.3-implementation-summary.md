    "previousImage", "nextImage", "zoomImage", "fullscreen"...
  },
  
  "specs": {
    // Technical specifications interface (6 keys)
    "searchSpecs", "expandAll", "collapseAll"...
  },
  
  "catalog": {
    // PDF catalog functionality (11 keys)
    "title", "view", "download", "loading"...

  }
}
```

### 5. Technical Architecture Decisions ✅

#### Backend Enhancement Approach
- **SKU-Based Routing**: More user-friendly than ID-based routes
- **Eager Loading**: Optimized database queries with proper includes
- **Related Products Algorithm**: Multi-criteria recommendation engine

#### Frontend Component Strategy
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Modular, reusable components
- **Performance-First**: Lazy loading, proper memoization, and debouncing
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript for basic functionality

#### State Management Pattern
```typescript
// Local component state for UI interactions
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('overview');
const [zoomLevel, setZoomLevel] = useState(100);

// Server state management with SWR/React Query pattern (prepared)
const product = await fetch(`/api/products/sku/${sku}`);

// Context state for cart/wishlist (existing integration)
const { addToCart } = useCart();
```
