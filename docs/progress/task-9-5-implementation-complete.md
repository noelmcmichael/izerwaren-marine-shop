  - Product duplicate detection
  - State synchronization across components

- **useRecentlyViewed Hook**:
  - Automatic 30-day cleanup
  - 20 item limit with LRU eviction
  - Debounced tracking to prevent rapid-fire events
  - Date/time persistence with proper serialization

- **useProductActions Hook**:
  - Unified cart, quote, and comparison actions
  - Integration with existing toast notification system
  - Mock API simulation with realistic success/failure rates
  - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### Component Architecture
- **ComparisonBar**: 
  - Floating position with responsive behavior
  - Product thumbnails with animation
  - Mobile-first design with collapsible details
  - Proper SSR handling with hydration safety

- **ComparisonTable**:
  - Desktop: Full side-by-side table view
  - Mobile: Card-based swipeable interface
  - Specification difference highlighting
  - Print-optimized styles

- **RecentlyViewed**:
  - Horizontal scrolling carousel
  - Touch-friendly mobile navigation
  - Lazy loading and performance optimization
  - Integration with existing product card system

### Performance Optimizations
- **Client-Side Only Rendering**: Proper SSR/hydration handling to prevent mismatch
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup of event listeners and timers
- **Storage Efficiency**: Automatic cleanup of old data
- **Debounced Operations**: Prevent excessive API calls or storage writes
- **React.memo**: Memoization for complex comparison components

## 🌐 Internationalization Implementation

### Translation Coverage
```json
// English (en.json) - 75+ keys
"comparison": {
  "title": "Product Comparison",
  "comparisonBar": { /* 5 keys */ },
  "table": { /* 12 keys */ },
  "messages": { /* 6 keys */ },
  "empty": { /* 3 keys */ },
  "mobile": { /* 3 keys */ }
},
"recentlyViewed": {
  "title": "Recently Viewed",
  "carousel": { /* 3 keys */ },
  "messages": { /* 2 keys */ },
  "privacy": { /* 3 keys */ }
}
```

### Language-Specific Considerations
- **Spanish**: Marine hardware terminology with proper technical translations
- **French**: Professional B2B language with Canadian French considerations
- **German**: Industrial terminology with proper compound words
- **Regional Formatting**: Currency, dates, and numbers properly localized
