# Image Migration Implementation Roadmap

## 🎯 Objective
Upload 2,807 local product images to Shopify CDN and update database with actual Shopify URLs, replacing outdated `izerwaren.biz` URLs.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
1. **File Mapping**: Map local files in `images_bak/products/` to database ProductImage records
2. **Image Upload**: Upload all valid images to Shopify using GraphQL API
3. **Database Update**: Replace old URLs with actual Shopify CDN URLs
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress reporting with success/error counts
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing files, upload failures, API limits
6. **Validation**: Verify image quality, format, and size constraints before upload

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| **API Rate Limits** | Upload failures | Implement 500ms delays between uploads |
| **Large File Sizes** | Upload timeouts | Pre-process images with Sharp compression |
| **Missing Local Files** | Broken references | Validate file existence before upload |
| **Database Inconsistency** | Data corruption | Use transactions for database updates |
| **Network Failures** | Incomplete uploads | Implement retry logic with exponential backoff |

## 🧪 Test Hooks
1. **File Validation**: `validateLocalImageFiles()` - check file existence and formats
2. **API Connectivity**: `testShopifyImageUpload()` - upload single test image
3. **Database Integrity**: `verifyImageUrlUpdates()` - confirm URL replacements
4. **End-to-End**: `uploadSampleBatch()` - process 5-10 images completely

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Discovery & Mapping
- [x] Identify local image files location (`images_bak/products/`)
- [x] Verify database image records (12,071 entries with old URLs)
- [x] Confirm Shopify API connectivity and image upload capability
- [ ] Map local files to database records by filename UUID
- [ ] Generate upload manifest with file paths and product associations

### Phase 2: Image Processing Pipeline
- [ ] Implement image validation (format, size, quality)
- [ ] Set up Sharp-based image optimization pipeline
- [ ] Create batch processing with concurrency control
- [ ] Add progress tracking and error logging

### Phase 3: Shopify Integration
- [ ] Implement MediaService upload methods using existing code
- [ ] Add rate limiting and retry logic
- [ ] Create database transaction handling for URL updates
- [ ] Add rollback capability for failed uploads

### Phase 4: Migration Execution
- [ ] Run validation tests on sample batch (10 images)
- [ ] Execute full migration with monitoring
- [ ] Verify upload success and database consistency
- [ ] Generate completion report

## 📋 Success Metrics
- **Upload Success Rate**: >95% of local files successfully uploaded
- **Database Accuracy**: 100% of uploaded images have correct Shopify URLs
- **Performance**: Average upload rate >10 images/minute
- **Data Integrity**: No broken image references in production

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Existing MediaService with Shopify GraphQL integration
- Sharp library for image processing
- PostgreSQL database with ProductImage model
- Shopify Admin API with image upload permissions

## 📅 Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 hours (mapping and validation)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 hours (processing pipeline) 
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 hours (API integration)
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 hours (execution + verification)
- **Total**: 8-12 hours for complete implementation
